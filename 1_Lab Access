With access to the Kali box established, open a new Terminal and execute the following command:
```bash
su - kali
```


The next step is to start an RDP session to the target workstation.

Start the RDP session using the command below:  
```bash 
xfreerdp3 /u:ricksmith /p:Spring2025! /v:10.10.X.20 /cert:ignore
```  
> **Compromised workstation:** `Win11.lab.local`      
> **IP:** `10.10.X.20`  
> **User:** `ricksmith`  
> **Password:** `Spring2025!`  



This RDP connection allows the attacker to interact with the breached system's graphical interface as the specified user, potentially enabling further lateral movement or post-exploitation activities within the environment.
