# Red Team: Simulated Breach Lab @ Denmark 2025
## (What If the Attacker Already Got In?) 

The following test environment has been established to demonstrate the tools, techniques, and procedures commonly employed by red team operators in the execution of their objectives during a red team engagement.

This controlled environment is designed to simulate real-world scenarios, allowing for the practical application and evaluation of offensive security tactics while ensuring a safe and isolated setting for testing purposes.

In this lab environment, various common attack scenarios are simulated to reflect real-world vulnerabilities frequently found in enterprise networks.

The objective is to provide hands-on experience in identifying, exploiting, and mitigating these weaknesses. Participants will explore techniques that adversaries often use to gain initial access, move laterally, escalate privileges, and persist within Active Directory environments.

Key areas of focus include misconfigurations in Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS), credential theft via Kerberoasting, exploitation of weak passwords, discovery of sensitive data on shared folders, and other typical misconfigurations that contribute to organizational risk.

## Red Team Lab Order:
1. Lab Access 
2. Initial Compromise and Weaponization 
3. Enumeration and Reconnaissance
4. Service Misuse and Exploitation       
5. Lateral Movement
